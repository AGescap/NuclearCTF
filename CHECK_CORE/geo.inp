*OPTION FOR CORE MODELING
** 1 = Model as shown in the following map
** 4 = Model using quarter core symmetry
** 8 = Model using eighth core symmetry
** Note: If using options 4 or 8, make a map of 
**       the full core and the preprocessor will
**       take care of breaking it down into quarter
**       or eighth symmetry
